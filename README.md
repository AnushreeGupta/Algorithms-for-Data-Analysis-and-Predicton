# Algorithms for Data Analysis and Predicton

### GOALS:

Major goals of the this labwork are to:
1. Decide on the algorithms that will be used in solving the problem based on the data characteristics and the attributes of the problems.
2. Learn to apply algorithms: linear regression, K-NN and K-means, which algorithm to use and why and when.
3. Make valid and reasonable assumptions about the variables (features) of a problem, goodness of a model fit, metrics for evaluation of errors, outliers, scaling, and choosing appropriate data ranges for the computation.
4. Choose the parameters for prediction based on experimentation (repeated trials) and acceptable values of error rates. Document the experimentation process and the rationale.
5. Plot the outcomes for easy visualization of data analysis.
6. Interpret the results to enable decision making.

This lab is divided into three featured activities.

### Featured Activity 1: Linear Model

In this activity we will work with National Hockey League player's data. There are many interesting observations. The two variables we will relate are Goals and Assists that each of these players. Our main goal is to fit a linear (regression) model to this data. Assists on Y-axis and Goals on X-axis.

* Input: NHL Top 100 players 
* Output: Fitted Linear models
* Process: “lm” model of R, summary of metrics in a table and interpretation of the results.

### Featured Activity 2: K-nn classification with credit data

Implement K-nn classification on provided data. Tabulate your results for various K. Also try it for various sizes for test and training set (20-80%, 30-70%, etc.)

### Featured Activity 3: K-means clustering with Pew Data

Work with Pew Research Dataset related to Gaming, Jobs and Broadband. Use at least 5 variables (columns) to cluster the data and understand the data. Interpret the cluster characteristics for various K = 3, 5.
